# Targeted Retention Strategies

1. Enhance Early Customer Engagement and Onboarding

- Focus: New customers (tenure < 12 months) with a high churn risk.
- Strategy: Implement a structured onboarding program, including educational resources, personalized check-ins, and special offers during the first year. Consider loyalty incentives or discounts to improve customer satisfaction early on.

2. Promote Long-Term Contract Options

- Focus: Monthly contract customers with high churn rates.
- Strategy: Provide incentives for switching to annual or biennial contracts, like reduced monthly charges or free service add-ons. Longer contracts may encourage stability and lower churn.

3. Develop Targeted Engagement for Internet Service Customers

- Focus: Fiber Optic subscribers, who have higher churn rates than DSL.
- Strategy: Conduct satisfaction surveys and address pain points, particularly around service quality and pricing. Offer Fiber Optic users a special package or upgrade options to DSL if feasible.

4. Implement Age-Specific Retention Programs

- Focus: Senior citizen customers with higher churn rates.
- Strategy: Create age-friendly programs such as easy billing, customized support services, and senior-focused communication methods. Discounts or loyalty points may encourage retention among older customers.

5. Address Payment Method Friction

- Focus: Customers paying via Electronic Check.
- Strategy: Offer a promotion or discount for switching to more reliable payment methods like credit cards or bank transfers. Consider evaluating potential user experience issues with the Electronic Check method.

6. Customize Retention Offers for Family-Oriented and Partnered Customers

- Focus: Customers with dependents and partners, who tend to churn less.
- Strategy: Encourage continued engagement with family or multi-user packages that provide value for households, reinforcing retention within these customer groups.

7. Paperless Billing Alternatives

- Focus: Paperless Billing customers with a moderate churn rate.
- Strategy: Send proactive billing reminders and engage customers with educational content on paperless benefits. Offer an option to switch back to paper billing to those who request it to reduce churn related to billing preferences.
